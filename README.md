# dataStructuresAndAlgorithms - dynamic programming
I like to code intuitively, and have tried incorporating as much intuition as possible in this repo that deals with dynamic programming problems. Methods followed are uniform and build on top of each other. 
It is advisable to start in the given order:
1. knapsack (0-1, unbounded)
2. longest common subseq
3. matrix chain multiplication
